# class-activity
This Python script finds all valid pairs of positive integers (a, b) such that the sum of their cubes equals a given target number (like 1728). It uses nested loops to generate pairs and checks if the sum of cubes equals the target.
Changes Made

Fixed syntax errors related to function definition, list creation, and exponentiation.

Corrected the print statements to use Python's print() function instead of printf().

Replaced ranges() with range() in the loops.

Fixed the mathematical calculation for cube root and cube sum.
